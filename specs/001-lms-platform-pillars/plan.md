# LogosLMS Platform Implementation Plan

## Constitution Check

This plan MUST align with LogosLMS constitution principles:
- [x] Accessibility & UX (WCAG AA compliance)
- [x] Data Security & Privacy (Supabase Auth + RLS)
- [x] Architecture & Tech Stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4)
- [x] Performance Standards (Lighthouse ≥ 90)
- [x] Multi-Tenancy (organization_id, RLS, tenant isolation)
- [x] AI Ethics & Safety (human-in-the-loop, labeling, opt-in)
- [x] Gamification Fairness (trust-based motivation system)
- [x] Onboarding & Accounts (super-admin, self-service)
- [x] Documentation & QA (current docs, DoD, reviews)
- [x] Scope Control (MVP focus)

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** LogosLMS Platform with Three Pillars  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Timeline:** 2025-12-19 - 2026-03-19 (12 weeks)  
**Team:** Development Team

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Build multi-tenant LMS platform with strict data isolation
- [ ] Implement AI Coach & Learning Partner with human-in-the-loop validation
- [ ] Create trust-based motivation system for learner engagement
- [ ] Establish complete onboarding flow from super-admin to organization setup

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Lighthouse Score: ≥ 90
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation: 100% data separation verified
- [ ] AI content approval: 100% human validation required
- [ ] User onboarding: < 5 minutes from invitation to first course

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- [ ] Multi-tenant architecture with organization_id in all domain objects
- [ ] Supabase Auth with JWT containing organization_id
- [ ] Next.js 15 App Router with TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Tailwind CSS v4 with Shadcn UI components
- [ ] Abstract AI service interface with provider-specific implementations

### Security
- [ ] All data access through RLS policies
- [ ] Organization-specific cache keys: `{organization_id}:{resource_type}:{resource_id}`
- [ ] Audit logging for all admin actions
- [ ] Privacy-by-default with GDPR compliance
- [ ] No client secrets exposure

### Performance
- [ ] Performance requirements as specified in spec.md (Lighthouse ≥ 90, < 2s load time, < 100ms DB queries)
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance with elder-friendly design

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] Set up Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
- [ ] Configure Supabase project with RLS policies
- [ ] Implement multi-tenant database schema
- [ ] Create authentication system with organization context
- [ ] Set up basic UI components with Shadcn UI
- [ ] Implement organization setup wizard for super-admin

### Phase 2: Core LMS Features (Weeks 4-7)
- [ ] Build course creation and management system
- [ ] Implement user invitation and role management
- [ ] Create profile management for all user types
- [ ] Develop lesson and quiz functionality
- [ ] Build enrollment and progress tracking
- [ ] Implement organization branding and theming

### Phase 3: AI & Motivation System (Weeks 8-10)
- [ ] Create abstract AI service interface
- [ ] Implement AI content generation with approval workflow
- [ ] Build AI coaching features for learners
- [ ] Develop trust-based motivation system (points/badges)
- [ ] Create leaderboards and progress visualization
- [ ] Implement AI content approval interface

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, accessibility)
- [ ] Performance optimization and monitoring setup
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation failure: Implement comprehensive RLS testing and regular security audits
- [ ] AI content quality issues: Require human approval for all AI-generated content with clear labeling
- [ ] Performance degradation with scale: Implement proper caching strategies and database indexing

### Medium Risk
- [ ] Supabase integration complexity: Start with basic features and gradually add advanced functionality
- [ ] Accessibility compliance gaps: Regular testing with screen readers and accessibility tools
- [ ] User adoption challenges: Focus on intuitive UX design and comprehensive onboarding

## Definition of Done

Each feature MUST include:
- [ ] Security review completed (RLS policies verified)
- [ ] Accessibility review completed (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Performance testing passed (Lighthouse ≥ 90)
- [ ] Documentation updated (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- [ ] Code review approved (peer review required)
- [ ] Tests written and passing (unit, integration, accessibility)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified (no cross-tenant data leaks)
- [ ] AI safety measures implemented (human validation, clear labeling)
