# Project Plan Template

## Constitution Check

This plan MUST align with LogosLMS constitution principles:
- [x] Accessibility & UX (WCAG AA compliance) - Current UI components support keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- [x] Data Security & Privacy (Supabase Auth + RLS) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Supabase integration not yet implemented
- [x] Architecture & Tech Stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind v4) - Confirmed: Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Shadcn UI
- [x] Performance Standards (Lighthouse ≥ 90) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance testing not yet implemented
- [x] Multi-Tenancy (organization_id, RLS, tenant isolation) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-tenancy architecture not yet implemented
- [x] AI Ethics & Safety (human-in-the-loop, labeling, opt-in) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: AI integration not yet implemented
- [x] Gamification Fairness (anti-gaming measures) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Gamification system not yet implemented
- [x] Onboarding & Accounts (super-admin, self-service) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Onboarding flow not yet implemented
- [x] Documentation & QA (current docs, DoD, reviews) - In progress with this planning workflow
- [x] Scope Control (MVP focus) - This plan focuses on extending current implementation to LMS MVP

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** LogosLMS Platform Extension - Default UI Design Foundation  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Timeline:** 2024-12-19 - 2024-12-26  
**Team:** Development Team

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Extend current Next.js 15 dashboard implementation to serve as LMS foundation
- [ ] Implement multi-tenant architecture with organization-based data isolation
- [ ] Create comprehensive UI component library for LMS-specific features
- [ ] Establish Supabase integration for authentication and data management

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Dashboard serves as functional LMS starting point: 100% of core LMS routes accessible
- [ ] Multi-tenancy isolation verified: 0 cross-tenant data leaks
- [ ] UI component coverage: 90% of LMS features have reusable components
- [ ] Performance baseline established: Lighthouse score ≥ 90

## Technical Context

### Current Implementation Analysis
**Existing Foundation:**
- Next.js 15 App Router with TypeScript strict mode ✅
- Tailwind CSS v4 with Shadcn UI component library ✅
- Comprehensive UI components: forms, tables, cards, dialogs, sidebar ✅
- Authentication pages (login/register) with React Hook Form + Zod ✅
- Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation ✅
- Data table implementation with TanStack Table ✅

**Current Dashboard Pages:**
- `/dashboard/default` - Analytics dashboard with charts and data tables
- `/dashboard/crm` - CRM-style dashboard with operational cards
- `/dashboard/finance` - Financial dashboard with account overview
- `/dashboard/coming-soon` - Placeholder for future features

**Current Auth Implementation:**
- Login/Register forms with validation
- Social auth (Google) integration
- Multiple auth page layouts (v1, v2)
- Form handling with React Hook Form + Zod

**Missing LMS-Specific Features:**
- Multi-tenant organization management
- Course/lesson content management
- User role-based access control
- AI coaching interface
- Gamification system
- Supabase integration

### Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- [x] Next.js 15 App Router implementation - Current foundation
- [x] TypeScript strict mode - Already configured
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 styling - Current implementation
- [ ] Multi-tenant architecture with organization_id - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] Supabase Auth with RLS policies - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

### Security
- [ ] All data access through RLS - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] No client secrets exposure - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] Audit logging for admin actions - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] Privacy-by-default implementation - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse score ≥ 90 - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] Cross-tenant cache isolation - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [ ] Optimized database queries - NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- [x] WCAG AA compliance - Current UI components support accessibility

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Multi-Tenancy
- [ ] Set up Supabase project and configure authentication
- [ ] Implement multi-tenant database schema with RLS policies
- [ ] Create organization management system (super-admin console)
- [ ] Implement user invitation and role management system
- [ ] Update authentication flow to support organization context

### Phase 2: Core LMS UI Components
- [ ] Create course management components (course cards, lesson viewer, quiz interface)
- [ ] Implement user profile and account management pages
- [ ] Build organization branding and theme customization system
- [ ] Create role-based navigation and access control
- [ ] Implement organization switcher component

### Phase 3: AI & Gamification Features
- [ ] Build AI coaching interface for learners
- [ ] Create AI content generation tools for instructors
- [ ] Implement gamification system (points, badges, leaderboards)
- [ ] Add progress tracking and analytics dashboards
- [ ] Create collaboration features (forums, messaging)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation failure: Implement comprehensive RLS testing and audit logging
- [ ] Supabase integration complexity: Start with basic auth, gradually add advanced features
- [ ] Performance degradation with multi-tenancy: Implement proper caching strategies and query optimization

### Medium Risk
- [ ] UI component library gaps: Extend existing Shadcn components rather than building from scratch
- [ ] Authentication flow complexity: Use Supabase Auth UI components where possible
- [ ] State management across organizations: Implement clear separation in Zustand stores

## Definition of Done

Each feature MUST include:
- [ ] Security review completed (RLS policies verified)
- [ ] Accessibility review completed (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Performance testing passed (Lighthouse ≥ 90)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified (no cross-tenant data leaks)
- [ ] Documentation updated (component docs, API contracts)
- [ ] Code review approved (constitution compliance verified)
- [ ] Tests written and passing (unit + integration tests)
