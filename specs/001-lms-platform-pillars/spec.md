## Overview

LogosLMS is a comprehensive Learning Management System designed for Christian education organizations. The platform delivers three core pillars: Core LMS functionality, AI Coach & Learning Partner, and Gamification, all built on a multi-tenant architecture with a compliant onboarding flow. The system supports seeded super-admin → organization setup → organization admin invites, with self-service account management for all non-super-admin users.
