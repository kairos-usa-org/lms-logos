# Research Findings

## Supabase Integration for Multi-Tenant LMS

### Decision: Use Supabase Auth + Database with RLS for Multi-Tenancy

**Rationale:**
- Supabase provides built-in authentication with JWT tokens that can carry organization context
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies provide database-level tenant isolation
- Real-time subscriptions support collaborative features
- Built-in API generation reduces development time
- Excellent Next.js integration with server-side rendering support

**Alternatives considered:**
- Custom authentication system: Too complex for MVP, security risks
- Firebase: Less flexible for complex multi-tenant queries
- AWS Cognito + RDS: Higher complexity, more expensive

**Implementation approach:**
- Use Supabase Auth for user management with custom claims for organization_id
- Implement RLS policies on all tables with organization_id filters
- Use Supabase client for real-time features and data fetching
- Server actions for sensitive operations to maintain security

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Patterns

### Decision: Shared Database with RLS + Organization Context in JWT

**Rationale:**
- Cost-effective for MVP (single database instance)
- RLS provides strong tenant isolation at database level
- JWT tokens carry organization context for request routing
- Easier to implement cross-tenant analytics and reporting
- Simpler backup and maintenance procedures

**Alternatives considered:**
- Database per tenant: Higher costs, complex management
- Schema per tenant: Limited scalability, complex migrations
- Application-level filtering: Security risks, prone to errors

**Implementation details:**
- All domain tables include `organization_id` column
- RLS policies enforce tenant isolation: `organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::UUID`
- JWT tokens include `organization_id` in custom claims
- Server actions read organization from JWT, not client parameters

## Performance Optimization for Multi-Tenancy

### Decision: Implement Cache Key Isolation + Database Indexing

**Rationale:**
- Prevents cross-tenant cache leaks through organization-specific cache keys
- Database indexes on organization_id improve query performance
- CDN integration for static assets with tenant-specific paths
- Connection pooling with tenant-aware routing

**Alternatives considered:**
- Global caching: Risk of data leaks between tenants
- No caching: Poor performance, high database load
- Tenant-specific cache instances: High infrastructure costs

**Implementation strategy:**
- Cache keys format: `{organization_id}:{resource_type}:{resource_id}`
- Database indexes on `(organization_id, created_at)` for time-based queries
- Redis for session storage with organization context
- CDN with tenant-specific asset paths

## AI Integration Architecture

### Decision: Provider-Agnostic AI Service with Human-in-the-Loop Validation

**Rationale:**
- Flexibility to switch AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Human validation ensures content quality and appropriateness
- Organization-level opt-in controls for compliance
- Clear labeling of AI-generated content for transparency

**Alternatives considered:**
- Direct API integration: Vendor lock-in, less flexibility
- No human validation: Quality risks, inappropriate content
- Mandatory AI features: Compliance issues, user resistance

**Implementation approach:**
- Abstract AI service interface with provider-specific implementations
- Content generation requires instructor approval before publishing
- Clear "AI-generated" labels on all AI content
- Organization settings to enable/disable AI features
- Prompt templates optimized for Christian education context

## Gamification System Design

### Decision: Points + Badge System with Anti-Gaming Measures

**Rationale:**
- Simple to implement and understand for users
- Badge system provides clear achievement milestones
- Anti-gaming measures maintain educational integrity
- Transparent scoring system builds trust

**Alternatives considered:**
- Complex skill trees: Too complex for MVP
- No gamification: Lower engagement
- External gamification platform: Additional costs, integration complexity

**Implementation details:**
- Points for: course enrollment (10), lesson completion (5), quiz pass (20), streak bonus (5)
- 10-level badge system with clear criteria
- Rate limiting: max 1 quiz attempt per hour
- Duplicate submission detection
- Pattern analysis for suspicious activity
- Leaderboards with privacy controls

## Security and Privacy Implementation

### Decision: Privacy-by-Default with Comprehensive Audit Logging

**Rationale:**
- GDPR compliance for faith-based organizations handling personal data
- Audit logs provide accountability and security monitoring
- Privacy-by-default reduces data exposure risks
- Encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data

**Alternatives considered:**
- Opt-in privacy: Higher risk of data exposure
- Minimal logging: Security monitoring gaps
- Client-side encryption only: Server-side vulnerabilities

**Implementation strategy:**
- All personal data encrypted at rest using Supabase encryption
- Audit logs for all admin actions and data access
- User consent management for data processing
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Accessibility Implementation

### Decision: WCAG AA Compliance with Elder-Friendly Design

**Rationale:**
- Legal requirement for accessibility compliance
- Faith-based organizations serve diverse age groups including elderly
- Enhanced accessibility improves overall user experience
- Future-proofs the application for broader adoption

**Alternatives considered:**
- Basic accessibility: Legal compliance risks
- WCAG AAA: Too restrictive for MVP timeline
- No accessibility focus: Excludes important user segments

**Implementation approach:**
- All interactive elements keyboard navigable
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Scalable text up to 200% without horizontal scrolling
- Clear focus indicators and intuitive navigation
- Regular accessibility testing with screen readers

## Performance Standards

### Decision: Lighthouse Score ≥ 90 with Multi-Tenant Optimization

**Rationale:**
- High performance improves user experience and SEO
- Multi-tenant architecture requires careful performance planning
- Performance directly impacts scalability and costs
- Lighthouse provides comprehensive performance metrics

**Alternatives considered:**
- Lower performance targets: Poor user experience
- Performance optimization after MVP: Technical debt accumulation
- No performance monitoring: Unidentified bottlenecks

**Implementation strategy:**
- Code splitting by user role and organization
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- CDN integration for static assets
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization
