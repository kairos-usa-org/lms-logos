# LogosLMS Platform Research

**Generated:** 2025-10-18  
**Purpose:** Resolve technical unknowns and establish best practices for LogosLMS implementation

## Research Tasks

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture Patterns

**Task:** Research multi-tenant architecture patterns for Next.js applications with Supabase

**Decision:** Row-Level Security (RLS) with organization_id in all domain objects

**Rationale:** 
- RLS provides database-level security enforcement
- organization_id pattern ensures consistent tenant isolation
- Supabase RLS integrates seamlessly with Next.js middleware
- Supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant users

**Alternatives considered:**
- Database-per-tenant: Too complex for MVP, higher operational overhead
- Schema-per-tenant: Limited by Supabase constraints, harder to manage
- Application-level filtering: Security risk, prone to human error

### 2. AI Service Integration Patterns

**Task:** Research AI service integration patterns for multi-tenant applications

**Decision:** Abstract service interface with provider-specific implementations

**Rationale:**
- Enables provider switching without code changes
- Supports both cloud and on-premises deployments
- Allows for A/B testing of different AI providers
- Maintains consistent error handling and rate limiting

**Alternatives considered:**
- Direct API integration: Tight coupling, harder to test
- Microservice architecture: Overkill for MVP, added complexity
- Serverless functions: Vendor lock-in, limited control

### 2a. Email Service Integration

**Task:** Research email service integration for user invitations and notifications

**Decision:** Resend API for transactional emails

**Rationale:**
- Developer-friendly API with excellent documentation
- High deliverability rates for transactional emails
- Built-in templates and analytics
- Competitive pricing for MVP scale
- Easy integration with Next.js applications

**Alternatives considered:**
- SendGrid: More complex setup, higher cost
- AWS SES: Requires more configuration, lower-level API
- Mailgun: Good alternative but Resend has better DX

### 3. Caching Strategies for Multi-Tenancy

**Task:** Research caching strategies that prevent cross-tenant data leaks

**Decision:** Organization-specific cache keys with Redis

**Rationale:**
- `{organization_id}:{resource_type}:{resource_id}` format ensures isolation
- Redis provides fast access and TTL support
- Clear naming convention prevents accidental cross-tenant access
- Supports both application and database query caching

**Alternatives considered:**
- Global cache with tenant filtering: Security risk, complex invalidation
- Tenant-specific cache instances: High operational overhead
- No caching: Poor performance, not scalable

### 4. Audit Logging Best Practices

**Task:** Research audit logging best practices for compliance and security

**Decision:** Immutable audit logs with structured data and retention policies

**Rationale:**
- Immutable logs ensure data integrity for compliance
- Structured data enables efficient querying and analysis
- 7-year retention meets most compliance requirements
- JSONB format provides flexibility for different event types

**Alternatives considered:**
- File-based logging: Harder to query, not scalable
- External logging service: Additional cost, vendor dependency
- Database-only logging: Performance impact, storage costs

### 5. Performance Optimization for Multi-Tenant Apps

**Task:** Research performance optimization techniques for multi-tenant applications

**Decision:** Database indexing, query optimization, and CDN integration

**Rationale:**
- Proper indexing on organization_id and common query patterns
- Query optimization reduces database load
- CDN for static assets improves global performance
- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size

**Alternatives considered:**
- Database sharding: Complex for MVP, operational overhead
- Read replicas: Additional cost, eventual consistency issues
- Microservices: Overkill for MVP, distributed system complexity

### 6. Accessibility Implementation Patterns

**Task:** Research WCAG AA compliance implementation patterns for React applications

**Decision:** Shadcn UI components with custom accessibility enhancements

**Rationale:**
- Shadcn UI provides solid accessibility foundation
- Custom enhancements ensure WCAG AA compliance
- Consistent patterns across all components
- Screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS

**Alternatives considered:**
- Custom component library: High development overhead
- Third-party accessibility library: Additional dependency, potential conflicts
- Basic HTML elements: Poor UX, inconsistent styling

### 7. AI Content Safety and Validation

**Task:** Research AI content safety patterns for educational applications

**Decision:** Human-in-the-loop validation with content labeling

**Rationale:**
- Human validation ensures content appropriateness
- Clear labeling maintains transparency
- Approval workflow prevents inappropriate content
- Audit trail for compliance and improvement

**Alternatives considered:**
- Automated content filtering: High false positive rate, limited context understanding
- No validation: Safety risk, potential inappropriate content
- External moderation service: Additional cost, privacy concerns

### 8. Gamification System Design

**Task:** Research gamification patterns that encourage learning without gaming

**Decision:** Trust-based motivation system with transparent point allocation

**Rationale:**
- Trust-based system reduces complexity and overhead
- Transparent point allocation maintains fairness
- Focus on learning outcomes rather than point accumulation
- Simple badge system provides recognition

**Alternatives considered:**
- Complex anti-gaming measures: High development overhead, poor UX
- No gamification: Reduced engagement, missed learning opportunities
- External gamification platform: Vendor lock-in, limited customization
