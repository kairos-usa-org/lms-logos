# LogosLMS Platform Implementation Tasks

**Feature:** LogosLMS Platform with Three Pillars  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Generated:** 2024-12-19

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope:** Focus on Super-Admin and Organization Admin user stories first to establish the multi-tenant foundation, then build core LMS features, followed by AI and motivation systems.

**Delivery Approach:** Incremental delivery with each user story being independently testable and deployable.

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order:**
1. **US1 (Super-Admin)** → **US2 (Organization Admin)** → **US3 (Mentor)** → **US4 (Learner)**
2. **US1** must complete before **US2** (organization creation prerequisite)
3. **US2** must complete before **US3** and **US4** (user invitation prerequisite)
4. **US3** and **US4** can be developed in parallel after **US2** completion
