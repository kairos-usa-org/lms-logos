# LogosLMS Platform Implementation Tasks

**Generated:** 2025-10-18  
**Feature:** LogosLMS Platform with Three Pillars  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Total Tasks:** 127  
**Estimated Duration:** 12 weeks (Nov 1, 2025 - Jan 24, 2026)

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, dependency-ordered task list for implementing the LogosLMS platform. Tasks are organized by user stories to enable independent implementation and testing. Each task follows the strict checklist format with clear file paths and parallel execution opportunities.

## User Stories Priority Order

1. **P1 - Super-Admin Setup** (US1): Create initial organization and assign first admin
2. **P1 - Organization Admin Management** (US2): Configure branding, invite users, manage groups
3. **P1 - Mentor Content Creation** (US3): Author courses, lessons, quizzes with AI assistance
4. **P1 - Learner Experience** (US4): Enroll in courses, study, receive AI coaching, earn points
5. **P2 - Profile Management** (US5): Self-service profile and password management for all users

## Implementation Strategy

- **MVP Scope:** Focus on User Stories 1-4 (P1) for initial release
- **Incremental Delivery:** Each user story phase is independently testable
- **Parallel Execution:** Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel
- **Dependency Management:** Clear prerequisites ensure proper execution order
